      synopsis: 'Everyone agreed after Gorillaz blew the roof off the Werchter stage in 2018 - the brainchild of comic artist Jamie Hewlett and Blur’s Damon Albarn is one of the best live acts ever. Some of the headlines: ‘So much grandeur’. ‘An infectious carnival’. ‘Dancing towards a better world’. Shortly afterwards, Albarn announced that we shouldn’t expect too much over the next ten years. Then in January this year, they presented the musical concept ‘Song Machine’. And next year, the first virtual band in history is heading back out on tour. From now on, Gorillaz will release music in episodes, whenever new material is ready. Each episode features a different guest:  in 2020 the likes of slowthai, Fatoumata Diaware, Peter Hook (New Order), Georgia and Octavian joined forces with the band.  ',

      name: 'The Lumineers',
      synopsis: '‘Ho Hey’ by The Lumineers was one of the sounds of 2012. The American folk-rock band are as meteoric at winning hearts as the not entirely dissimilar Mumford & Sons. Around the world ‘Ho Hey’ dominated the charts for a seriously long time - in the US alone it clocked up 62 weeks and five million copies. The reason for that success, people say, is the authenticity of The Lumineers. Acoustic instruments, cuddly people, brilliant anthems. But their cheerful banjo pop also has depth to it. Drummer Jeremiah Fraites’ brother Josh was guitarist Wesley Schutz’s best friend. When Josh died of an overdose in 2002, Jeremiah and Wesley found solace in the music they created together. At home in America today, The Lumineers are a stalwart, and Jack White has declared himself to be a fan. The excellent album ‘III’ (2019) should rekindle the European connection.      ',

      synopsis: 'Hold down Alt + J on an Apple keyboard and you get Δ, the Greek letter ‘delta’. Mathematicians and physicists use this symbol to denote change. One might say that alt-J do something similar with pop history. The British trio picks the best moments of the last sixty years and subverts them within their own universe. They are just as committed and inventive as Sigur Rós or The xx. Their fairytale world is clearly at home at Werchter. As Humo wrote of their first appearance in 2013: ‘How much excruciating beauty can one person take, and how much sugary emotion? Alt-J changed your life in The Barn.’ And as Moustique witnessed in 2015: ‘Alt-J joins the big league.’ There has been a promising silence around the group since their last tour in 2017 …',

      synopsis: 'Royal Blood is an unashamedly loud duo from Brighton in the UK. The duo found each other when bassist/vocalist Mike Kerr returned from a trip to Australia in 2013. Drummer Ben Thatcher picked him up at the airport, and on the way home they decided to start a band. They played their first gig the very next day. Royal Blood produce a delicious kind of noise that has been compared to Queens of The Stone Age and The White Stripes. They were catapulted into the limelight when Arctic Monkeys drummer Matt Helders wore one of the band’s t-shirts on stage at Glastonbury 2013. Next, they were selected for BBC Sound Of 2014, the annual list of promising artists drawn up by members of the UK music press. A review of their previous Werchter appearance in 2017 said, ‘Royal Blood played the main stage to smithereens’. This is the pair’s fifth time.',
